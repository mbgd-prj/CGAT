A genome-wide inversion associated with a genome-specific insertion into the
joints (-ab-cd- to -y-ba-x-cd-) that were observed between two genome sequences of bacterial genus Neisseria, N. meningitidis strain Z2491 and strain MC58.
A inverted region is indicated by green line. MC58 genome-specific inserted regions, 'x' and 'y', are indicated by black solid line and dotted line, respectively. Alignments of the joints revealed homology-relationship indicated by the pair of red arrows and the pair of blue arrows.
