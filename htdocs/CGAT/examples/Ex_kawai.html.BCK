A genome-wide inversion associated with a genome-specific
insertion into the joints (-ab-cd- to -y-ba-x-cd-) that were observed
between two genome sequences of bacterial genus <i>Neisseria</i>,
<i>N. meningitidis </i> strain Z2491 and strain MC58.  The inverted region
is indicated by green line. MC58 genome-specific inserted regions, 'x'
and 'y', are indicated by black solid line and dotted line,
respectively. Alignments of the joints revealed homology-relationship
indicated by the pair of red arrows and the pair of blue arrows.
