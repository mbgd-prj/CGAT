A genome-wide inversion associated with a genome specific insertion
into the joints observed between two genome sequences
<i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> strains Z2491 and MC58.
This polymorphism is schematically illustrated in
the upper left quadrant, in which the two regions 
specifically inserted into the MC58 genome are indicated by black
solid line and dotted line, respectively, along the vertical axis.
Two duplicated segments are also found at the joints of these insertions,
which are indicated by the red and blue arrowheads, respectively.

<p>
This structure is easily seen by CGAT using the function for 
independent scaling of the horizontal or vertical axis.
In the lower left quadrant, zooming the vertical axis clearly shows
the presence of a MC58-specific insertion between the boundaries of
the inversion sites, while in the upper right quadrant, zooming
the horizontal axis shows the presence of two duplicated
segments in the MC58 genome at the joints of the inversion.
Whereas the difference between these structures is quite clear in
these figures, it is difficult to distinguish them on the global
view of the dotplot display shown in the lower right quadrant.

<p>
A plausible explanation for the formation of this polymorphism is
given in the paper.
