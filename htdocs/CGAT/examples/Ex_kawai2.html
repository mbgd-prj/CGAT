(A)-(B) Alignment of the same regions by different alignment engines. 
</B>

Whereas BLASTN (A) detected only partial homology between the two regions,
FASTA (B), more-sensitive program than BLASTN, detected weakly
similar sequences between the two regions. The regions where homology
is detected by FASTA correspond to two Neisserial filamentous (Nf)
phage copies, Nf3-A and Nf4-G2(inv).  In (A) and (B), each alignment
is colored according to percentage identity, so that 100% is colored
green, 85% is colored yellow, 50% is colored red, and the remaining
identities are interpolated between these colors.

(C) The actual sequence alignment in the region depicted in (B).

The actual sequence alignment is displayed with colors
assigned to each character as follows: white, match; red, mismatch;
green, gap.

Bold face letters in the consensus sequence indicate the sequence conserved
among not only these two Nf copies but also all Nf copies (not shown here).
